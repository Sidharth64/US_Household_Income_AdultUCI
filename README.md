# US_Household_Income_AdultUCI
US Household Income data from US Census was analysed.Data was accessed from a competition "Experiments with Data" hosted on Analytics Vidhya.

The follwing data had very high cardinality for some features. This problem was reasonably tackled through variable transformation by combinig the different categories of a feature strategically.

In the following analysis; Xgboost and decision tree were implemented.

Upon implementation it was observed that Xgboost performed better as compared to Decision Tree.

The final test accuracy of the Xgboost model was found to be 83%.
